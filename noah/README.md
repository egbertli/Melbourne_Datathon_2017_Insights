# Compliance
- Remove duplicates
- Calculate the purhcase interval at a Patient_ID, Drug level.
  (*Only include the drug which a patient has purhcased more than 5 times*)
  - The interval considered the pack size and repeats left, so the result should be intervals for standard pack-sized drugs
- Remove interval outliers
  - Some intervals are quite big, e.g., 2 purchases have a gap of 3 years.
  - Using .05 and .85 quantile
- Calculate the median of intervals at a Drug level
  - This is to get the standard interval for a standard pack-sized drug
- Calculate the MAD (Median Absolute Deviation) at a Drug level
  - Treat this as the **compliance** level for a drug, the higher the MAD is, the lower compliance level the drug is

## Ideas 
*(All points below nneds to consider the sample size, avoid small sample size)*
- Calculate the compliance level at an **illness level**
  (*Remoe 2016 and forward as diabetes patients are missing*)
  - which illness has the highest/lowest compliance level
- Calculate the compliance level at a **store level**
  - IsBannerGroup
  - State
  - postcode
- Calculate the compliance level at a more detailed **drug level**
  - EthicalCategoryName (Branded)
    - Generic drugs have the lowest non-compliance level, followed by Substitutable and Branded. See plots:
      - Non-Compliance Index by Brand
      - Non-Compliance Index by Brand (Chronic Illness Drugs)
  - EthicalSubCategoryName (PBS)
    - Majority of drugs which are most popular and compliant are covered by PBS, except a few. See plots:
