# Melbourne_Datathon_2017_Insights
There are still plenty of days left for Kaggle, so let us all focus on the insights competition first.

## A higher level plan
Based on our discussion, it might be more efficient to **1)** split our work (first week) and **2)** then regroup and make one (maximum two) story for the pitch (second week).

### The first week
The first week would be **EDA** until we find something interesting. 
Below is a list of initial ideas we came up during the "standup". Let us generate our ideas within our responsible area for now, but if you have some interesting ideas which fall into other's group, do let all of us know. Also, please do not limit our brains with the list below, it is more about dividing ourselves into different areas so we can work more effeciently. Hopefully we will be able to find out something very interesting ASAP so all of us can jump into it and kick off the next steps.

- Customer (Ivan & Cat)
  - Loyalty segmentation
  - Store of choice
  - Descriptive stats on demographic
  - (Patient ID could help impute age?)
  - etc.
- Txn Behaviour (Noah)
  - Shopper style
  - Basket analysis: association rule / word2vec
    - drugs [done]
    - disease
  - Shopping pattern for patients who got cured (potential best practice for other patients?)
  - etc.
- Disease (Michael)
  - Customer journey/Sankey chart on disease transition/Markov Chain
  - Condition analysis for Symptons/Ingredients vs. Disease
  - etc.
- Drug (Max)
  - Price elasticity (how sensitive is the sales corresponding to the price of products)
  - Product substitution (which drugs can be subtitutes for a drug)
  - etc.
  
  
### The second week
The second week (hopefully we could start this stage sooner) would be **story making**.
An agreed guideline is to make our story **easy to understand for general audience**, **engaging**, and **interesting/useful**. Try to avoid covering everything. Focusing on one or two things would be sufficient.
